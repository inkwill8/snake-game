# Snake Game Clone 🐍

## Overview 📑

The aim is to create a basic snake game clone in the browser using HTML Canvas, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. We'll be using foundational data 
structures like objects and arrays, incorporating state management, and making use of simple animation features provided by setInterval.

## Basic Features ⬇️
    * ▶️ Begin game button
    * 🔄 Reset game button
    * 🚙 Constant movement of snake with increasing speed after each 'bit' is added
    * ⇝  Snake should have 'trailing' behavior when moving
    * 🖲️ Game ends automatically when snake hits itself
    * □ The snake can cross canvas boundary and come out the other side
    * 🔢 A counter displaying how many 'bits' the player has eaten
